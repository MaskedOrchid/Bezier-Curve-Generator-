During High School I wrote an essay on the mathematics of Bézier Curves. In order to show how the terms of the Bézier Curves effects it's shape, I wrote a small python script that allows the user to play and create Bézier Curves in real time. Below are some preview of the Bézier Curves that the user can create.
